## Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

### The ticker symbol

* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

### Moderate solution

* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

### Hard solution

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

* Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
